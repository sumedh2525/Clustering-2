    "Q1. What is hierarchical clustering, and how is it different from other clustering techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical clustering is a method of cluster analysis that builds a hierarchy of clusters. It creates a tree-like structure known as a dendrogram, where each node represents a cluster. Hierarchical clustering is different from other clustering techniques in that it organizes data into a tree structure, capturing relationships between clusters at different levels of granularity. Other clustering techniques, such as K-means, assign data points to fixed clusters without explicitly considering a hierarchy."
